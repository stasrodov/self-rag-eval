Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger. In addition, the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name. Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidentiary documents, the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger's investigator had rummaged through Disney's garbage to retrieve the discarded evidence.

Spirits, good and bad, are popping up everywhere, and Indigo is becoming more powerful. But can she make the sacrifices necessary to become a medium, and will anyone ever understand why she's so different? 3. \"Taking to the Sky:\" Indigo is endowed with the wings of a crow, and she begins to learn to fight and slay demons. An attractive new boy appears in her tennis classes, but which world does he belong to, and why can everyone else see him? Indigo has met her first half-breed (half spirit, half human), but he might not be from God. 4. \"The Missing Pieces:\" Indigo is informed she's not as unique as she seems. As a medium of the element \"Air\", there are three others in the world of equal abilities (Fire, Earth, and Water.) She meets a red-haired rock guitarist, Xyzena, and begins to have suspicions the girl is more than she seems. But will their differences keep them from learning what they must about each other? 5. \"Rejection:\" When Xyzena refuses to accept the truth about her destiny, and Indigo's grandfather finally passes, Indigo spirals into depression. She resolves to quit her medium-work for good. In addition, Indigo's father loses his telepathic ability, Violet disconnects herself from the family and the outside world, and Kalpernia grows cold and indifferent towards her daughters: the family is falling apart. Gabriella worries Indigo is lost for good and hesitates to intervene, but only God knows Indigo's fate. 6. \"The Funeral:\" Indigo's family mourns the passing of David Hephaestus Muldoon, Jr. At the wake, Indigo is angry to see her high school rival, Kelly Martez and her sister (dressed in white, no less.) She writes a last letter to her grandfather, and slips one of the best pastel drawings into the coffin. She's disturbed by the black rosary that looks to be binding David's hands, so her uncle, Geoff (who's dating Kelly's mother), positions it so that he's holding it. During the church service, Indigo and Violet reconnect and comfort each other. The whole ordeal is uncomfortable and painful for Indigo's family, and she and her father feel the ceremonies were not handled as David would have wanted. 7. \"Losing Faith:\" Indigo's family is in turmoil: her father is extremely depressed and has lost his job, her sister is quiet and indifferent towards everyone, Indigo is enraged at the world and begins taking things into her own hands, and Kalpernia seems hateful towards Indigo for her actions. Indigo flashes back to a school trip to Washington, D.C. Returning home, the plane crashed and Indigo was the only survivor. She begins to wonder why this happened, and flirts with the idea of suicide. 8. \"Let Them Come:\" Indigo gets angry with Gabriella, and orders her to leave her alone. As Gabriella disappears, she warns Indigo that worse things will take her place. Knowing she's referring to demons, Indigo replies, \"Let them come\", signifying she's lost any hope or will to survive or go to Heaven. She loses her wings. Mortem is introduced for the first time after Indigo is flooded with visions of evil and pain. She can't communicate, but her mind is constantly broadcasting horrifying images she can't turn off. Indigo is now very seducible. 9. \"Heaven-Sent, Hellbent:\" Indigo and her friend, Lipong (suffering from social rejection and extreme anxiety) commit suicide, and a disparity turns their crime into tragedy. 10. \"Imprisoned:\" Having survived self-poisoning, Indigo is locked in a psychiatric ward for three days. For the first time, she feels a true lack of control. Her parents are in shock and despair. Violet has nothing to say. Will the coming of Samhain bring a fresh start for Indigo? 11. \"Unresolved Conflicts:\" Indigo's family appears to be self-destructing. Things do not look well at school for Indigo, either. The demons are still coming through, but Indigo refuses to do what they say in fear of further imprisonment. Mortem is appearing more, and getting Indigo to contemplate sex with him. 12. \"The Last Place to Fall From:\" Indigo gets drunk at a party, is \"felt-up\" (but not raped) by strange boys, and dances with Mortem (who appears to be a normal man to everyone present.) Gabriella decides Indigo has lost control and comes to her rescue despite being brutally dismissed in Book 8. She starts a fire in the house where the party takes place with a cigarette just as Mortem begins to fondle Indigo's breasts. Indigo retreats to her friend Sarah's house, and surprisingly, is perfectly fine by morning. Mortem, however, is furious and swears he will have revenge on the Angel. 13. \"The Beginnings of Recovery:\" Things take a slow turn for the better. Indigo's father gets a new job, Kalpernia's heart is turning, Violet is recovering by finding confidence in herself, and Indigo is striving for success in school and sports again. Realizing her physical life is taking an upturn, Indigo begins to wonder about her spiritual life. She misses her wings and her talents, and contemplates serving God again, but wonders if He will welcome her back. 14. \"The Hard Truths:\" Gabriella was reprimanded by El Shaddih for abandoning her duties to protect Indigo. She is told she will lose her place as Messenger Angel (as Gabriel did) if she continues to act out of her place. God is also displeased that Gabriella endangered dozens of people's lives to keep Mortem from getting to second base. Gabriella argues that Indigo is in dire need of a Guardian Angel because of her instability. God already has a perfect candidate, who will be tested immediately when Indigo becomes a hit-and-run victim. 15. \"Reunited:\" Indigo is thrilled to have Lipong as her new Guardian Angel. But she gets carried away when she convinces Lipong to show himself at school and play a few well-deserved tricks on his enemies. Gabriella talks to Indigo about the conditions of her return to God and how to get her wings back. 16. \"Hidden Attacks:\" Indigo's father has been suffering from strange, deadly dreams. Could he be psychic after all, or has he been possessed by the evil forces that fled Indigo's body? When a mysterious disappearing man commits several crimes throughout Seattle, Indigo must find out what his true motive is, and what HE is. 17. \"A Stolen Violet:\" When Violet develops a dangerous flu, her mind seems to have left her. But Indigo suspects that something has possessed her instead. Kalpernia, jealous of Indigo's gifts, keeps Indigo away from her sister. But will the mother's pride cost her the soul of her youngest daughter? Indigo resolves to leave her own body to enter Violet's and fight the demons. Someone must take her place so that her body does not die: Lipong is just the Angel to do it! But will the thrill of a mortal experience derail the Angel's good intentions, and leave Indigo trapped out of her body forever? 18. \"Shapeshifter:\" Indigo (a mild anorexic) finds out about a secret pro-ana convention in Seattle. Dozens of young girls are drawn to seek advice from the \"experts\". But Indigo quickly realizes the group is far too spiritual to simply be body-obsessed. The strange rituals and rites of passage seem oddly familiar, but the source of energy is all wrong. Why would demons want to spread anorexia, and what is their plan? 19. \"Return of the Phoenix:\" Xyzena and Indigo are reunited, and this time Xyzena is willing to listen. Indigo begins to learn about the strange, ginger-haired beauty who seems to have everything Indigo lacks (and vice versa.) Sinewy and powerful, Xyzena is a perfectionist: psychiatry intern by day; acoustic rock goddess by night. She is also a budding long-distance runner and karate student. But behind her relentless search for glory and popularity, something is missing. Can Indigo help her figure it out? And more importantly, can the two girls finally figure out how to work together using their very different skills and styles?]\n"

Indigo's talents are growing stronger, and visions are taking over her everyday life.

His death serves as a bridge which leads Indigo to the Spirit World and ultimately, to fulfill her destiny as a medium. 2. \\\"Spellbound:\\\" Indigo begins her work as a medium.
